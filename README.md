# Masked-Face-Recognition-in-Counter-Terrorism-during-the-COVID-19-Pandemic
The ultimate goal of our model is to identify terrorists while wearing face masks. Two different models of transfer learning are used on a CNN-based model, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 architectures. At first, the modelâ€™s parameters are finetuned on our masked-faces small dataset. Next, we used a hybrid dataset which contains masked and unmasked faces. There does not exist lots of prior work in this area, hence, the paper presents more than one approach to get the best results possible.
